# BattleShip-Game

Steps to play the game:-

1:  Place your ships in the coordinates you want.(Lower Half of the area is of Player)

2: Computer's ships are automatically places so you have to sink them before computer sink all
 your ships. Target coordinates at which you think computer's ship might be to sink it.

3: You can use special tactics to determine where computer ships are by attacking at particular coordinates,
if any ship is not present at the targated coordinate it will scan the cells attached to it for any other ships so
if any other ship is present in adjesent coordinates the attacked  coordinate will display "*" or if any ship is not
present in adjecent cells it will show "#", if any ship is present in that coordinate it will sink and the
coodinate converts to "X".Scanning of adjacent cells happens everywhere other than those cells which are at 
the borders i.e at the outermost cells of the grid(ex. 1-1, 3-1, 8-2, 3-8.... etc ).

4: So don't attack randomly, chose your targets wisely and scan the area tho narrow down the most probable 
locations of the computer ships.

4:When you sink all of computers ships you will win.
